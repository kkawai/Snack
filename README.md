# instachat: I forked a sample android chat app from google I/O where I added a bunch of things such as private chat, gifs, periscope-likes, authentication, richer notifications.  Something where I could really evaluate the different aspects of Firebase.
# You can see the app here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instachat.android
